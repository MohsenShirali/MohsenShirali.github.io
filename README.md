**Postdoctoral Researcher — ICTEAM / INGI, Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain), Belgium**

I received my Ph.D. (2025) and M.Sc. (2013) in Computer Engineering from Shahid Beheshti University (SBU), Tehran, Iran. My research focuses on the Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare, emphasizing system architecture, privacy, data analytics, and process mining. I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at UCLouvain, working on anomaly detection in Cyber-Physical Systems. I previously held research positions at KU Leuven (2023–2024) and the University of Passau (2019–2020), and I have lectured at SBU and Ahvaz Sama University. In addition to academia, I have several years of R&D experience in industry. I have received scholarships from DAAD and Iran’s MSRT and have published in journals and conferences. My interests include IoT, data science, security and privacy, anonymous communication, and process mining.
